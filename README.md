# Internship Assignment

Thanks for joining us this morning. We will be assessing your skills in this technical assignment. The assignment
consists of two parts: one database part and one programming part, both divided into smaller exercises. You will be
required to do **at least one exercise from each part**, so if you get stuck on one of the questions, please move over
to the next.

## Prerequisites

### For the databases part make sure you have installed:

- MySQL 5.7 or 8
- A tool to interact with your database, eg [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) (free), [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)
  (free trial) or only the CLI if youâ€™re super comfortable.

Alternatively can use the online tool SQL Fiddle which will not require anything to install, but this is maybe a bit
harder to work with.

### For the programming part you can choose to use Java, JavaScript or TypeScript as language:

- If you wish to use Java for the assignment, make sure you have installed Java 11.
- If you wish to use JavaScript/TypeScript for the assignment, please make sure you install
  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (the latest LTS version). Alternatively you can use [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or
  [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) which will not require anything to install.
- For any of the above, make sure you have an IDE ready to start coding.

## Assignments

The two parts with assignments can be found in the folders `databases` and `mombasa-port`. Good luck!

## Handing in

A few minutes before time runs out (11:30 CET), start handing in your work by putting all the source files (.sql,
.java/.js/.ts), so not just the answers, in one .zip file and emailing it to:
